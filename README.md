- 👋 Hi, I’m @banandy6
- 👀 I’m interested in finding code for upcoming Ada dex
- 🌱 I’m currently learning there are many fake projects 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding which ones are real and submitting code in GitHub, and if I'm a dumbass because maybe Haskell isn't used here
- 📫 How to reach me, well maybe just reply here
